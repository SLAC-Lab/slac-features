<p>For the past decade, Zhang and colleagues have been calculating and predicting the electronic properties of a special class of materials known as topological insulators, which conduct electricity only on their outside edges or surfaces and not through their interiors. When topological insulators are just one atom thick, their edges conduct electricity with 100 percent efficiency.

<p>In 2006 and 2009, Zhang’s group predicted that mercury telluride and several combinations of bismuth, antimony, selenium and tellurium should be topological insulators, and they were soon proven right in experiments performed by others.

To boost performance, research groups have tried creating new plastic materials that enhance the flow of electricity through the solar cell. Several groups expected to achieve good results by redesigning pliant polymers of plastic into orderly, silicon-like crystals, but the flow of electricity did not improve.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Recently, scientists discovered that disorder at the molecular level actually improves the polymers&#39; performance. Now Stanford University researchers have an explanation for this surprising result. Their findings, published in the Aug. 4 online edition of the journal&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nature.com/nmat/index.html" style="outline: 0px; font-style: inherit;"><em>Nature Materials</em></a>, could speed up the development of low-cost, commercially available plastic solar cells.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;People used to think that if you made the polymers more like silicon they would perform better,&quot; said study co-author&nbsp;<a href="http://salleo.stanford.edu/" style="outline: 0px; font-style: inherit;">Alberto Salleo</a>, an associate professor of materials science and engineering at Stanford. &quot;But we found that polymers don&#39;t naturally form nice, well-ordered crystals. They form small, disordered ones, and that&#39;s perfectly fine.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Instead of trying to mimic the rigid structure of silicon, Salleo and his colleagues recommend that scientists learn to cope with the inherently disordered nature of plastics.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 20px; outline: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17.265625px;"><strong>Speedy electrons</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In the study, the Stanford team focused on a class of organic materials known as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/popular.html" style="outline: 0px; font-style: inherit;">conjugated or semiconducting polymers</a>&nbsp;&ndash; chains of carbon atoms that have the properties of plastic, and the ability to absorb sunlight and conduct electricity.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Discovered nearly 40 years ago, semiconducting polymers have long been considered ideal candidates for ultrathin solar cells, light-emitting diodes and transistors. Unlike silicon crystals used in rooftop solar panels, semiconducting polymers are lightweight and can be processed at room temperature with ink-jet printers and other inexpensive techniques. So why aren&#39;t buildings today covered with plastic solar cells?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;One reason they haven&#39;t been commercialized is because of poor performance,&quot; Salleo said. &quot;In a solar cell, electrons need to move through the materials fast, but semiconducting polymers have poor electron mobility.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">To find out why, Salleo joined Rodrigo Noriega and Jonathan Rivnay, who were Stanford graduate students at the time, in analyzing more than two decades of experimental data. &quot;Over the years, many people designed stiffer polymers with the goal of making highly organized crystals, but the charge mobility remained relatively poor,&quot; Salleo said. &quot;Then several labs created polymers that looked disordered and yet had very high charge mobility. It was a puzzle why these new materials worked better than the more structured crystalline ones.&quot;</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 20px; outline: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17.265625px;"><strong>X-ray analysis</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">To observe the disordered materials at the microscopic level, the Stanford team took samples to the&nbsp;<a href="http://slac.stanford.edu/" style="outline: 0px; font-style: inherit;">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a>&nbsp;for X-ray analysis. The X-rays revealed a molecular structure resembling a fingerprint gone awry. Some polymers looked like amorphous strands of spaghetti, while others formed tiny crystals just a few molecules long.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;The crystals were so small and disordered you could barely infer their presence from X-rays,&quot; Salleo said. &quot;In fact, scientists had assumed they weren&#39;t there.&quot;</p>

The small size of the crystals was a crucial factor in improving overall performance, Salleo said.</p>

That explains why they have a much higher charge mobility than larger, unconnected crystals.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Another disadvantage of large crystalline polymers is that they tend to be insoluble and therefore cannot be produced by ink-jet printing or other cheap processing technologies, he added.</p>

Electrons will move through the crystals like on a superhighway, ignoring the rest of the plastic material, which is amorphous and poorly conducting.</p>

To boost performance, research groups have tried creating new plastic materials that enhance the flow of electricity through the solar cell. Several groups expected to achieve good results by redesigning pliant polymers of plastic into orderly, silicon-like crystals, but the flow of electricity did not improve.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Recently, scientists discovered that disorder at the molecular level actually improves the polymers\' performance. Now Stanford University researchers have an explanation for this surprising result. Their findings, published in the Aug. 4 online edition of the journal <a href="http://www.nature.com/nmat/index.html" style="outline: 0px; font-style: inherit;"><em>Nature Materials</em></a>, could speed up the development of low-cost, commercially available plastic solar cells.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">"People used to think that if you made the polymers more like silicon they would perform better," said study co-author <a href="http://salleo.stanford.edu/" style="outline: 0px; font-style: inherit;">Alberto Salleo</a>, an associate professor of materials science and engineering at Stanford. "But we found that polymers don\'t naturally form nice, well-ordered crystals. They form small, disordered ones, and that\'s perfectly fine."</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Instead of trying to mimic the rigid structure of silicon, Salleo and his colleagues recommend that scientists learn to cope with the inherently disordered nature of plastics.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 20px; outline: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17.265625px;"><strong>Speedy electrons</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong> </strong>In the study, the Stanford team focused on a class of organic materials known as <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/popular.html" style="outline: 0px; font-style: inherit;">conjugated or semiconducting polymers</a> – chains of carbon atoms that have the properties of plastic, and the ability to absorb sunlight and conduct electricity.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Discovered nearly 40 years ago, semiconducting polymers have long been considered ideal candidates for ultrathin solar cells, light-emitting diodes and transistors. Unlike silicon crystals used in rooftop solar panels, semiconducting polymers are lightweight and can be processed at room temperature with ink-jet printers and other inexpensive techniques. So why aren\'t buildings today covered with plastic solar cells?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">"One reason they haven\'t been commercialized is because of poor performance," Salleo said. "In a solar cell, electrons need to move through the materials fast, but semiconducting polymers have poor electron mobility."</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">To find out why, Salleo joined Rodrigo Noriega and Jonathan Rivnay, who were Stanford graduate students at the time, in analyzing more than two decades of experimental data. "Over the years, many people designed stiffer polymers with the goal of making highly organized crystals, but the charge mobility remained relatively poor," Salleo said. "Then several labs created polymers that looked disordered and yet had very high charge mobility. It was a puzzle why these new materials worked better than the more structured crystalline ones."</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 20px; outline: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17.265625px;"><strong>X-ray analysis</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">To observe the disordered materials at the microscopic level, the Stanford team took samples to the <a href="http://slac.stanford.edu/" style="outline: 0px; font-style: inherit;">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a> for X-ray analysis. The X-rays revealed a molecular structure resembling a fingerprint gone awry. Some polymers looked like amorphous strands of spaghetti, while others formed tiny crystals just a few molecules long.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">"The crystals were so small and disordered you could barely infer their presence from X-rays," Salleo said. "In fact, scientists had assumed they weren\'t there."</p>
