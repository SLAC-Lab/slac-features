He said that some of the award would likely relieve him of writing grant proposals. In addition, he said he would consider using some toward more travel. &quot;A lot of my better ideas in the past have started with travel and interactions with international collaborations,&quot; he said. &nbsp;&quot;And there&#39;s always a tradeoff between my work travel and family.&nbsp; I now might take my wife and young sons with me on some extended trips.&quot;</p>

The team&#39;s work with lysozyme represents the first-ever high-resolution experiments using serial femtosecond crystallography -- the split-second imaging of tiny crystals using ultrashort, ultrabright X-ray laser pulses (a femtosecond is one quadrillionth of a second).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, \'Liberation Sans\', FreeSans, sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">The technique utilized a higher resolution than previously achieved using X-ray lasers, allowing scientists to use smaller crystals than typical with other methods, and could also enable researchers to view molecular dynamics in a way never before possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, \'Liberation Sans\', FreeSans, sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">&ldquo;We were able to actually visualize the structure of the molecule at a resolution so high we start to infer the position of individual atoms,&rdquo; said Sébastien Boutet, a staff scientist at LCLS who led the research.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, \'Liberation Sans\', FreeSans, sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">&ldquo;Not only that, but the structure we observed matches the known structure of lysozyme and shows no significant sign of radiation damage, despite the fact that the pulses completely destroy the sample. This is the first high-resolution demonstration of the &lsquo;diffraction-before-destruction&rsquo; technique on biological samples, where we&rsquo;re able to measure a sample before the powerful pulses of the LCLS damage it,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, \'Liberation Sans\', FreeSans, sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">The team chose lysozyme as the first sample for their research because it is easy to crystallize and has been extensively studied. Their work not only determined lysozyme&rsquo;s structure at such high resolution that it showed individual amino acids, but also proved the ability to use extremely small crystals for a range of applications. Boutet says the team has also studied more complex proteins and systems that they are analyzing now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, \'Liberation Sans\', FreeSans, sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">Ultimately, scientists using LCLS are driving toward an atomic- and molecular-scale understanding of complex biological systems -- such as the membrane proteins that are critical in cell functions and the mechanisms that power photosynthesis -- which could lead to discoveries in a range of sciences, from pharmaceutical breakthroughs to new sources of alternative energy.</p>

Also key to the study was a novel custom-made detector, the Cornell-SLAC Pixel Array Detector (CSPAD), developed in collaboration between Cornell University and SLAC for use at the CXI instrument.<br>
	&quot;This important demonstration shows that the technique works, and it paves the way for a lot of exciting experiments to come,&quot; says Boutet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, \'Liberation Sans\', FreeSans, sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">The team\'s experiments, reported this week in <em style="background-color: transparent;">Science</em>, used SLAC’s <a href="http://www-public.slac.stanford.edu/lcls/WhatIsLCLS_1.aspx" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(21, 115, 146);" target="_blank">Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS)</a> to obtain ultra-high-resolution views of crystallized biomolecules, including a small protein found in egg whites called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysozyme" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(21, 115, 146);" target="_blank">lysozyme</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, \'Liberation Sans\', FreeSans, sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">For decades, scientists have reconstructed the shape of biological molecules and proteins by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_crystallography" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(21, 115, 146);" target="_blank">illuminating crystallized samples with X-rays</a> to study how they scatter the light. The team\'s work with lysozyme represents the first-ever high-resolution experiments using serial femtosecond crystallography -- the split-second imaging of tiny crystals using ultrashort, ultrabright X-ray laser pulses (a femtosecond is one quadrillionth of a second).</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, \'Liberation Sans\', FreeSans, sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">The technique utilized a higher resolution than previously achieved using X-ray lasers, allowing scientists to use smaller crystals than typical with other methods, and could also enable researchers to view molecular dynamics in a way never before possible.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, \'Liberation Sans\', FreeSans, sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">“We were able to actually visualize the structure of the molecule at a resolution so high we start to infer the position of individual atoms,” said Sébastien Boutet, a staff scientist at LCLS who led the research.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, \'Liberation Sans\', FreeSans, sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">“Not only that, but the structure we observed matches the known structure of lysozyme and shows no significant sign of radiation damage, despite the fact that the pulses completely destroy the sample. This is the first high-resolution demonstration of the ‘diffraction-before-destruction’ technique on biological samples, where we’re able to measure a sample before the powerful pulses of the LCLS damage it,” he added.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, \'Liberation Sans\', FreeSans, sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">The team chose lysozyme as the first sample for their research because it is easy to crystallize and has been extensively studied. Their work not only determined lysozyme’s structure at such high resolution that it showed individual amino acids, but also proved the ability to use extremely small crystals for a range of applications. Boutet says the team has also studied more complex proteins and systems that they are analyzing now.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, \'Liberation Sans\', FreeSans, sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">Ultimately, scientists using LCLS are driving toward an atomic- and molecular-scale understanding of complex biological systems -- such as the membrane proteins that are critical in cell functions and the mechanisms that power photosynthesis -- which could lead to discoveries in a range of sciences, from pharmaceutical breakthroughs to new sources of alternative energy.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, \'Liberation Sans\', FreeSans, sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">The experiment was the first study performed on the new Coherent X-ray Imaging (CXI) instrument, a “<a href="http://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/AnimationViewCXIScience.aspx" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(21, 115, 146);" target="_blank">molecular camera</a>” designed, built and commissioned by SLAC and now available to the scientific community. Also key to the study was a novel custom-made detector, the Cornell-SLAC Pixel Array Detector (CSPAD), developed in collaboration between Cornell University and SLAC for use at the CXI instrument.<br /><br />
	"This important demonstration shows that the technique works, and it paves the way for a lot of exciting experiments to come," says Boutet.</p>

<p>Researchers call the new material &quot;stanene,&quot; combining the Latin name for tin (<em>stannum</em>) with the suffix used in graphene, another single-layer material whose novel electrical properties hold promise for a wide range of applications.</p>

<p>&quot;Stanene could increase the speed and lower the power needs of future generations of computer chips, if our prediction is confirmed by experiments that are underway in several laboratories around the world,&quot; said the team leader, Shoucheng Zhang, a physics professor at Stanford and the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Sciences (SIMES), a joint institute with SLAC. The team&rsquo;s work was <a href="http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v111/i13/e136804">published recently in <em>Physical Review Letters</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Path to Stanene</strong></p>

<p>For the past decade, Zhang and colleagues have been calculating and predicting the electronic properties of a special class of materials known as topological insulators, which conduct electricity only on their outside edges or surfaces and not through their interiors. When topological insulators are just one atom thick, their edges conduct electricity with 100 percent efficiency. These unusual properties result from complex interactions between the electrons and nuclei of heavy atoms in the materials.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The magic of topological insulators is that by their very nature, they force electrons to move in defined lanes without any speed limit, like the German autobahn,&rdquo; Zhang said. &ldquo;As long as they&rsquo;re on the freeway &ndash; the edges or surfaces &ndash; the electrons will travel without resistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 2006 and 2009, Zhang&rsquo;s group predicted that mercury telluride and several combinations of bismuth, antimony, selenium and tellurium should be topological insulators, and they were soon proven right in experiments performed by others. But none of those materials is a perfect conductor of electricity at room temperature, limiting their potential for commercial applications.</p>

        'safe_value' => ' <p><em>Menlo Park, Calif.</em> — A single layer of tin atoms could be the world’s first material to conduct electricity with 100 percent efficiency at the temperatures that computer chips operate, according to a team of theoretical physicists led by researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University.</p>
<p>Researchers call the new material "stanene," combining the Latin name for tin (<em>stannum</em>) with the suffix used in graphene, another single-layer material whose novel electrical properties hold promise for a wide range of applications.</p>
<p>"Stanene could increase the speed and lower the power needs of future generations of computer chips, if our prediction is confirmed by experiments that are underway in several laboratories around the world," said the team leader, Shoucheng Zhang, a physics professor at Stanford and the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Sciences (SIMES), a joint institute with SLAC. The team’s work was <a href="http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v111/i13/e136804">published recently in <em>Physical Review Letters</em></a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Path to Stanene</strong></p>
<p>For the past decade, Zhang and colleagues have been calculating and predicting the electronic properties of a special class of materials known as topological insulators, which conduct electricity only on their outside edges or surfaces and not through their interiors. When topological insulators are just one atom thick, their edges conduct electricity with 100 percent efficiency. These unusual properties result from complex interactions between the electrons and nuclei of heavy atoms in the materials.</p>
<p>“The magic of topological insulators is that by their very nature, they force electrons to move in defined lanes without any speed limit, like the German autobahn,” Zhang said. “As long as they’re on the freeway – the edges or surfaces – the electrons will travel without resistance.”</p>
<p>In 2006 and 2009, Zhang’s group predicted that mercury telluride and several combinations of bismuth, antimony, selenium and tellurium should be topological insulators, and they were soon proven right in experiments performed by others. But none of those materials is a perfect conductor of electricity at room temperature, limiting their potential for commercial applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This initial demonstration achieved an acceleration gradient, or amount of energy gained per length of the accelerator, of 300 million electronvolts per meter. That\'s roughly 10 times the acceleration provided by the current SLAC linear accelerator.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Our ultimate goal for this structure is one billion electronvolts per meter, and we\'re already one-third of the way in our first experiment," said Stanford applied physics Professor Robert Byer, the principal investigator for this research.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Today\'s accelerators use microwaves to boost the energy of electrons. Researchers have been looking for more economical alternatives, and this new technique, which uses ultrafast lasers to drive the accelerator, is a leading candidate.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Particles are generally accelerated in two stages. First they are boosted to nearly the speed of light. Then any additional acceleration increases their energy, but not their speed; this is the challenging part.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In the accelerator-on-a-chip experiments, electrons are first accelerated to near light-speed in a conventional accelerator. Then they are focused into a tiny, half-micron-high channel within a glass chip just half a millimeter long. The channel had earlier been patterned with precisely spaced nanoscale ridges. Infrared laser light shining on the pattern generates electrical fields that interact with the electrons in the channel to boost their energy.

It <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0464" style="outline: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">simultaneously reports</a> in <em>Physical Review Letters</em> its success in using a laser to accelerate lower-energy electrons.</p>

Byer said laser accelerators could drive compact X-ray free-electron lasers, comparable to SLAC\'s <a href="https://portal.slac.stanford.edu/sites/lcls_public/Pages/Default.aspx" style="outline: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">Linac Coherent Light Source</a>, that are all-purpose tools for a wide range of research.</p>

<p>An international team of researchers working at the Department of Energy&#39;s (DOE) SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory produced from scratch an accurate model of lysozyme, a well-studied enzyme found in egg whites, using the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-ray laser and sophisticated computer analysis tools.</p>

<p>This work is the latest in a rapid progression of important advances at LCLS, which began operations for users in 2010. For example, <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2012-11-29-sleepingsickness.aspx">last year</a> researchers used LCLS to determine the structure of an enzyme that can hold African sleeping sickness in check, which makes it a promising drug target.

<p>For this study the researchers chose lysozyme, whose structure has been known for decades, because it offered a good test of whether their method produced accurate results. They soaked lysozyme crystals in a solution containing gadolinium, a metal that bonded with the lysozyme to produce a strong signal when subjected to the intense X-ray light. It was this signal from the gadolinium atoms that enabled exact reconstruction of the lysozyme molecule.</p>

<p>The team hopes to adapt and refine the technique to explore more complex proteins such as membrane proteins, which serve a range of important cellular functions and are the target of more than half of all new drugs in development.

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Recently, scientists discovered that disorder at the molecular level actually improves the polymers&#39; performance.

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Discovered nearly 40 years ago, semiconducting polymers have long been considered ideal candidates for ultrathin solar cells, light-emitting diodes and transistors. Unlike silicon crystals used in rooftop solar panels, semiconducting polymers are lightweight and can be processed at room temperature with ink-jet printers and other inexpensive techniques. So why aren&#39;t buildings today covered with plastic solar cells?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;One reason they haven&#39;t been commercialized is because of poor performance,&quot; Salleo said. &quot;In a solar cell, electrons need to move through the materials fast, but semiconducting polymers have poor electron mobility.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">To find out why, Salleo joined Rodrigo Noriega and Jonathan Rivnay, who were Stanford graduate students at the time, in analyzing more than two decades of experimental data. &quot;Over the years, many people designed stiffer polymers with the goal of making highly organized crystals, but the charge mobility remained relatively poor,&quot; Salleo said. &quot;Then several labs created polymers that looked disordered and yet had very high charge mobility. It was a puzzle why these new materials worked better than the more structured crystalline ones.&quot;</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 20px; outline: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17.265625px;"><strong>X-ray analysis</strong></h3>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">To observe the disordered materials at the microscopic level, the Stanford team took samples to the&nbsp;<a href="http://slac.stanford.edu/" style="outline: 0px; font-style: inherit;">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a>&nbsp;for X-ray analysis. The X-rays revealed a molecular structure resembling a fingerprint gone awry. Some polymers looked like amorphous strands of spaghetti, while others formed tiny crystals just a few molecules long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;The crystals were so small and disordered you could barely infer their presence from X-rays,&quot; Salleo said. &quot;In fact, scientists had assumed they weren&#39;t there.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">By analyzing light emissions from electricity flowing through the samples, the Stanford team determined that numerous small crystals were scattered throughout the material and connected by long polymer chains, like beads in a necklace. The small size of the crystals was a crucial factor in improving overall performance, Salleo said.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Being small enables a charged electron to go through one crystal and rapidly move on to the next one,&quot; he said. &quot;The long polymer chain then carries the electron quickly through the material. That explains why they have a much higher charge mobility than larger, unconnected crystals.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Another disadvantage of large crystalline polymers is that they tend to be insoluble and therefore cannot be produced by ink-jet printing or other cheap processing technologies, he added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Our conclusion is that you don&#39;t need to make something so rigid that it forms large crystals,&quot; Salleo said. &quot;You need to design something with small, disordered crystals packed close together and connected by polymer chains. Electrons will move through the crystals like on a superhighway, ignoring the rest of the plastic material, which is amorphous and poorly conducting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;In some sense, the synthetic chemists were ahead of us, because they made these new materials but didn&#39;t know why they worked so well,&quot; he said. &quot;Now that they know, they can go out and design even better ones.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">And Salleo offered a final piece of advice. &quot;Try to design a material that can live with as much disorder as possible,&quot; he said. &quot;Take the disorder for granted. Personally, I really like disorder. Just look at my office.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">To find out why, Salleo joined Rodrigo Noriega and Jonathan Rivnay, who were Stanford graduate students at the time, in analyzing more than two decades of experimental data. "Over the years, many people designed stiffer polymers with the goal of making highly organized crystals, but the charge mobility remained relatively poor," Salleo said. "Then several labs created polymers that looked disordered and yet had very high charge mobility. It was a puzzle why these new materials worked better than the more structured crystalline ones."</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 20px; outline: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17.265625px;"><strong>X-ray analysis</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">To observe the disordered materials at the microscopic level, the Stanford team took samples to the <a href="http://slac.stanford.edu/" style="outline: 0px; font-style: inherit;">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a> for X-ray analysis. The X-rays revealed a molecular structure resembling a fingerprint gone awry. Some polymers looked like amorphous strands of spaghetti, while others formed tiny crystals just a few molecules long.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">"The crystals were so small and disordered you could barely infer their presence from X-rays," Salleo said. "In fact, scientists had assumed they weren\'t there."</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">By analyzing light emissions from electricity flowing through the samples, the Stanford team determined that numerous small crystals were scattered throughout the material and connected by long polymer chains, like beads in a necklace. The small size of the crystals was a crucial factor in improving overall performance, Salleo said.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Being small enables a charged electron to go through one crystal and rapidly move on to the next one," he said. "The long polymer chain then carries the electron quickly through the material. That explains why they have a much higher charge mobility than larger, unconnected crystals."</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Another disadvantage of large crystalline polymers is that they tend to be insoluble and therefore cannot be produced by ink-jet printing or other cheap processing technologies, he added.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Our conclusion is that you don\'t need to make something so rigid that it forms large crystals," Salleo said. "You need to design something with small, disordered crystals packed close together and connected by polymer chains. Electrons will move through the crystals like on a superhighway, ignoring the rest of the plastic material, which is amorphous and poorly conducting.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">"In some sense, the synthetic chemists were ahead of us, because they made these new materials but didn\'t know why they worked so well," he said. "Now that they know, they can go out and design even better ones."</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: \'normal Arial\', Helvetica, sans-serif;">And Salleo offered a final piece of advice. "Try to design a material that can live with as much disorder as possible," he said. "Take the disorder for granted. Personally, I really like disorder. Just look at my office."</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The EEGs Parvizi conducts register brain activity from more than 100 electrodes placed inside the brain; Chafe selects certain electrode/neuron pairings and allows them to modulate notes sung by a female singer. As the electrode captures increased activity, it changes the pitch and inflection of the singer&#39;s voice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Before the seizure begins &ndash; during the so-called pre-ictal stage &ndash; the peeps and pops from each &quot;singer&quot; almost synchronize and fall into a clear rhythm, as if they&#39;re following a conductor, Chafe said.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In the moments leading up to the seizure event, though, each of the singers begins to improvise. The notes become progressively louder and more scattered, as the full seizure event occurs (the ictal state). The way Chafe has orchestrated his singers, one can hear the electrical storm originate on one side of the brain and eventually cross over into the other hemisphere, creating a sort of sing-off between the two sides of the brain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After about 30 seconds of full-on chaos, the singers begin to calm, trailing off into their post-ictal rhythm. Occasionally, one or two will pipe up erratically, but on the whole, the choir sounds extremely fatigued.</p>

It&#39;s often impossible to know whether a person with epilepsy is acting confused because they are having a seizure, or if they are experiencing the type of confusion that is a marker of the post-ictal seizure phase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The EEGs Parvizi conducts register brain activity from more than 100 electrodes placed inside the brain; Chafe selects certain electrode/neuron pairings and allows them to modulate notes sung by a female singer. As the electrode captures increased activity, it changes the pitch and inflection of the singer\'s voice.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Before the seizure begins – during the so-called pre-ictal stage – the peeps and pops from each "singer" almost synchronize and fall into a clear rhythm, as if they\'re following a conductor, Chafe said.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In the moments leading up to the seizure event, though, each of the singers begins to improvise. The notes become progressively louder and more scattered, as the full seizure event occurs (the ictal state). The way Chafe has orchestrated his singers, one can hear the electrical storm originate on one side of the brain and eventually cross over into the other hemisphere, creating a sort of sing-off between the two sides of the brain.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After about 30 seconds of full-on chaos, the singers begin to calm, trailing off into their post-ictal rhythm. Occasionally, one or two will pipe up erratically, but on the whole, the choir sounds extremely fatigued.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It\'s the perfect representation of the three phases of a seizure event, Parvizi said.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; outline: 0px; font-weight: 500; font-size: 16px; font-family: Georgia, \'Times New Roman\', serif; color: rgb(80, 76, 64); line-height: 18px;"><strong>Part art exhibit, part experiment</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Caring for a person with seizures can be very difficult, as not all seizure activity manifests itself with behavioral cues. It\'s often impossible to know whether a person with epilepsy is acting confused because they are having a seizure, or if they are experiencing the type of confusion that is a marker of the post-ictal seizure phase.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">To that end, Parvizi and Chafe hope to apply their work to develop a device that listens for the telltale brain patterns of an ongoing seizure or a post-ictal fatigued brain state.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Someone – perhaps a mother caring for a child – who hasn\'t received training in interpreting visual EEGs can hear the seizure rhythms and easily appreciate that there is a pathological brain phenomenon taking place," Parvizi said.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The device can also offer biofeedback to non-epileptic patients who want to hear the music their own brain waves create.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The effort to build this device is funded by Stanford\'s Bio-X Interdisciplinary Initiatives Program (Bio-X IIP), which provides money for  interdisciplinary projects that have potential to improve human health in innovative ways. Bio-X seed grants have funded 141 research collaborations connecting hundreds of faculty since 2000. The proof-of-concept projects have produced hundreds of publications, dozens of patents, and more than a tenfold return on research funds to Stanford.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4em; letter-spacing: 0.1px; color: rgb(87, 86, 83); font-family: \'Source Sans Pro\', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">From a clinical perspective, the work is still very experimental.</p>
